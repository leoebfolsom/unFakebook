# unFakebook
A Google Chrome extension that removes fake news from your newsfeed based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites" target="_blank">Wikipedia's list of fake news sites.</a>

Here is a list of the terms that are filtered out:

["ABCnews.com.co","Bloomberg.ma","cnn-trending.com","DrudgeReport.com.co","MSNBC.com.co","MSNBC.website","usatoday.com.co","washingtonpost.com.co","Celebtricity","Cream BMP","Empire News","Empire Sports","The Enduring Vision","Firebrand Left","Global Associated News","Huzlers","Indecision Forever","The Last Line of Defense","LinkBeef","KMT 11 News","National Report","Newslo","News Mutiny","React 365","Rile News","Stuppid","The Boston Tribune","The News Nerd","Conservative Frontline","Denver Guardian","International Report","Naha Daily","News Hound","United Media Publishing","InfoWars","Natural News","Prntly","Red Flag News","Activist Post","American News","Before It's News","Civic Tribune","Daily Buzz Live","DC Gazette","Disclose TV","Empire Herald","Gummy Post","Liberty Writers News","Media Mass","News Examiner","News Breaks Here","The News Buzz Daily","NewsWatch33","Now 8 News","Real News Right Now","The Reporterz","World Truth TV","yournewswire.com"]

It of course will not remove ALL fake news, but hopefully it will help.

Please let me know if it fails to remove fake news from these sites, or feel free to reach out for any other reason!
